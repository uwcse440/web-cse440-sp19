         college students efficiently organize their time as well as improve their time management
         skills?</q> by enabling college students to organize assignments, events, and study groups using
         integration with Canvas, Google calendars, and other work tools.

         <h1>Why do we care?</h1>
         <p>
            It is a serious problem that the majority of college students have poor time management
            skills. From freshmen who have not experienced the free college life to seniors who are
            overwhelmed by the impending pressure from the real world, college students often
            experience stress and anxiety caused by poor time management skills.
         </p>
         <p>
            College life is beautiful, but it is not easy for students to <strong>keep track of the
            increased workload, social commitments</strong>, and for <strong>many work hours.</strong>
            Managing their works can be particularly difficult. Their busy and chaotic schedules
            cause a lot of stress. Students are required to use many different tools, such as
            calendars, to-do lists, Canvas, and etc to manage their time effectively. However, there
            is a lot of <strong>unnecessary work in manually copying</strong> and updating data
            between all of these tools and it’s possible to make mistakes, leading to
            disorganization and even missed assignments.

      <div id="ourGoal" class="container">
         <h1>Our Goal</h1>
         <p>
            Therefore, our goal with this project is to make this process easier and less stressful
            for college students to manage their time and provide a less intrusive way to
            incentivize them keep on track of their tasks/assignments.
         </p>
      </div>
      <div id="uxResearch" class="container">
         <h1>UX Research</h1>
         <p>
            We wanted to hear from college students to understand their existing workflows. In
            particular, we were curious to hear from students who had previously used a time
            management tool to find out what successes to build on and what pitfalls we could avoid.
         </p>
         <h2>Step 1: Survey</h2>
         <img class="center" src="survey.png" alt="survey" />
         <p>
            We started out with a survey which we posted on various UW internet spaces and shared
            with our classmates.
         </p>
         <p>
            Our main goals were to understand the participants’ workflows, so that we could <strong>
            augment their current efforts</strong>  and reduce or eliminate the tasks that are
            difficult for the users as opposed to what most time management apps do: <strong>force
            the user to manage their time the way the developers believe they should rather than the
            way that people actually do.</strong> This mistake causes many people to stop using
            apps and we wanted to avoid that problem.
         </p>
         <p>
            After analyzing the survey data, we had a basic understanding of our users:
         </p>
         <ul>
            <li>the majority of students do not plan more than 1–2 days in advance</li>
            <li>being “too pushy” is one reason why students stop using the time management apps</li>
         </ul>
         <p>
            We were also very interested in users’ previous pros and cons experience on using
            specific time management tools, however, we didn’t get a lot of specific data through a
            survey. Therefore, we opted to do interview studies to get more details about how
            students use tools in their workflow.
         </p>
         <h2>Step 2: Semi-structured Interviews</h2>
         <p>
            The interview study was conducted with 4 undergraduate UW college students. We asked
            them to talk about how they plan their schedule and then adapted questions to find out
            more about their workflow and their past experiences with time management tools. From
            this, we were able to understand two key ideas.
         </p>
         <p>
            First, students generally use a combination of Canvas plus a calendar and/or a to-do
            list to effectively manage their time. Second, many students use study groups as a way
            to increase their productivity and collaborate on assignments. <strong>These insights
               heavily guided our design, leading to a tool which integrates these three tasks:</strong>
         </p>
         <ul>
            <li>Planning and visualizing the schedule with a <strong>smart calendar</strong></li>
            <li>Prioritizing tasks with a <strong>task list</strong></li>
            <li>Forming/finding <strong>study groups</strong></li>
         </ul>
      </div>
      <div id="ux/uiResearch" class="container">
         <h1>UX/UI Research</h1>
         <p>
            Based on what we found, we used paper prototypes to convey our initial design ideas.
         </p>
         <h2>Step 3: Initial Paper Prototypes</h2>
         <img class="center" src="paperPrototype1.png" alt="Paper Prototype 1" />
         <p>
            Our initial design ideas had undergone major alterations and refinements through the
            heuristic analysis from classmates and usability testing.
         </p>
         <h2>Step 4: Heuristic Analysis</h2>
         <img class="center" src="paperPrototype2.png" alt="Paper Prototype 2" />
         <p>
            To increase the visibility of the systems state and provide more information to the
            user, as shown in Figure 4, we highlighted the tab at the bottom that represents the
            current tab, calendar, tasks, and Study Together, and we added small temporary pop-ups
            to notify the users that they successfully added a task to their task list or calendar
            or joined or created a study group.
         </p>
         <h2>Step 5: Usability Testing</h2>
         <p>
            We conducted our usability test with the TA and other two UW undergraduate students.
            We chose TA as our first participant because he has experience designing interfaces and
            with the design process. The other two participants were random undergraduates that we
            found studying in Odegaard. We chose random students because we believe that random
            sampling would best represent our target user base.
         </p>
         <p>
            Changes we had made based on TA’s feedback: <strong>To plan events in the short term by
            adding a daily view to the calendar.</strong> While we did add a daily view, we
            addressed the feedback slightly differently. <strong>We added a planning mode.</strong>
         </p>
         <img class="center" src="paperPrototype3.png" alt="Paper Prototype 3" />
         <p>
            The other critical piece of feedback that we received was to <strong>better integrate
            the Study Together feature with the other components of the app.</strong> As a result,
            we decided to add buttons to the right side of every task .
         </p>
         <img class="center" src="paperPrototype4.png" alt="Paper Prototype 4" />
         <p>
            During tests with students, we focused on what was intuitive for the users and what they
            either did not think to use or could not locate. As a result of the feedback we received
            from the tests, <strong>we revised our task creation form</strong>. We removed the
            points/grade element entirely since neither participant understood what it was and we
            added a link to the website the task came from. The most surprising finding was that
            <strong>the planning mode was not as intuitive as we believed it to be.</strong> Users
            did not realize that you could drag tasks onto the calendar to add events. Thus, we
            added small dialog boxes to help explain the less intuitive functionality to new users.
         </p>
         <h2>Step 6: Hi-Fi Mockup</h2>
         <img class="center" src="hiFiPrototype.png" alt="Hi Fi Prototype" />
         <p>
            When we transitioned from the paper prototype to the digital mockup we kept most of the
            elements from our prototype the same. There were obvious improvements to <strong>layouts
            and color schemes</strong> but the key functionality and appearance were mostly
            unchanged. However, there were <strong>two significant changes.</strong>
         </p>
         <img class="center" src="compare1.png" alt="Compare 1" />
         <p>
            First, we <strong>added a map visualization to the group details page.</strong> Now
            whether the user selects a group from the list mode or map mode, they will be able to
            see where this group is located. And to add some fun to our app, we replaced the text
            box to the speech bubble;), conveying a sense of chatting with each other.
         </p>
         <p>
            Second, we changed the workflow of joining a group starting from the task list. In the
            below paper prototype, you select the “Study Together” button from the button navigation
            bar and it takes you to the main page to select a group.
         </p>
         <img class="center" src="compare2.png" alt="Compare 2" />
         <p>
            However, in our digital mockup, a list of the available groups is embedded in the
            “Tasks” details page. The user selects a group to view the details and can join. This
            way, the user can select a group based around this task, without leaving the “Tasks” tab.
         </p>
         <img class="center" src="compare3.png" alt="Compare 3" />
         <p>
            This iterative process of analyzing and revising has greatly changed our design from its
            initial stages to our high fidelity prototype. This process has made our design more
            effective, more intuitive, and increased its overall quality.

      <div id="projectRetrospective" class="container">
         <h1>Project Retrospective</h1>
         <h2>College Students and Time Management Systems</h2>
         <p>
            One of the most interesting and surprising things we learned about college students
            through this process was students’ opinions on the current landscape of time management
            tools. Specifically, the fact that students spoke positively about time management
            systems they had used previously and then stopped using permanently. These applications
            were effective. They helped students perform better in school, students had more spare
            time using them, and students were less stressed. However, students still stopped using
            them. Despite us all being college students ourselves this still shocked us. When we
            began this project we believed that the other time management systems available fail
            because they were lacking something important or annoyed their users. Finding out this
            fact during our first round of research spurred us to conduct interviews to discover
            why. After conducting the interview portion of the research we learned that college
            students stopped using these effective tools because they were not easy to use. To
            obtain the level of functionality to be useful they require the user to spend a lot of
            time entering data and making various decisions. Students do not want to add yet another
            daily task to their already stressful schedules. Learning just how important it was to
            our users that they <strong>do not need to spend much time or effort to manage our time</strong>
            allowed us to design something that better addresses the specific needs of college students.
         </p>
         <h2>Constraints and Limitations</h2>
         <p>
            There were Four main constraints that we identified during our user research.
         </p>
         <ol>
            <li>The tool should not require large amounts of time or effort to use effectively.</li>
            <p>
               The first constraint was the most important. We decide to address this constraint
               primarily by automating the most tedious and common task that all time management
               systems share data entry. Our app automatically retrieves information about class
               times, office hours, and assignment information from the various websites college
               students must use for their classes and uses that information to populate a calendar
               with the corresponding events, place their assignments in a task list, and collect
               information on relevant study groups in the Study Together feature. We further
               reduced the effort students need to plan their schedule by including a “suggestions”
               feature that will generate study times and add them to the calendar all with a single
               tap. Later in development during the usability testing, we received feedback that
               indicated that we needed to make it easier to plan single days. To address this
               concern we added a planning feature (explained in greater detail above) that allowed
               users to plan today and the next day by dragging tasks from their task list onto the
               calendar. Most users only plan a single day in advance so the addition of the
               planning feature helps the app comply with this constraint.
            </p>
            <li>The tool should not be annoying or invasive.</li>
            <p>
               One problem many currently available time management systems suffer from is that they
               constantly remind the user to do certain tasks at certain times by bombarding them
               with notifications or by penalizing them if they do not. Our research found that
               college students hate apps that constantly bother them to make them feel guilty. As a
               result, we designed Time Man to be a more passive and assistive tool. We did not
               include any punitive features and we did not add any push notifications.
            </p>
            <li>The tool should be accessible anywhere.</li>
            <p>
               We learned that college students wanted access to their planning tools where ever
               they were. Thus we designed Time Man to be a mobile application because nearly all
               college students have near constant access to their cellphones.
            </p>
            <li>The tool should integrate seamlessly with the tool students already use.</li>
            <p>
               Designing our application to adhere to this constraint was a bit difficult. During
               our user research, we discovered that the most popular time management tools among
               college students were a simple to-do list and calendar. Using this insight we
               combined these two features with our original ideas into an all-inclusive system.
            </p>
         </ol>
         <h2>Roadmap and Impact</h2>
         <p>
            Time Man was originally designed specifically for University of Washington undergraduate
            college students. Looking towards the future Time Man could easily be expanded to
            encompass both the postgraduate community here at the University of Washington and other
            universities across the United States. The prevalence of overstressed and struggling
            college students is not a problem that only exists at the University of Washington.
            These and other similar issues affect college students everywhere and an extraordinary
            rate. A lack of well developed time management skills can seriously impact a students
            success in school leading to increased levels of stress and anxiety.
         </p>
         <p>
            We believe that our application can help combat these problems. If successful, our
            application can help students manage their time better allowing them to complete
            assignments with confidence or receive help if they need it raising grades, plan social
            events with their friends, and feel more in control of their college experience. If
            students do not learn to effectively manage their time the problems they face in college
            with only plague them in their professional lives after they graduate. By assisting
            college students our application can help them learn this critical skill before the lack
            negatively affects their academics and their professional development.
