                            of time like a full work day or vacations. Dog owners who work or travel often are concerned about 
                            the daily interactions that dogs need to be healthy such as feeding, going outside, and exercising. 
                            Astro is an innovative product that tackles this problem space and provides a one-in-all solution 
                            for dog owners.
                        </p>

                            no one will be keeping the dog safe 100% of the time. We want to create a product that helps these

                        <p class="lead">To begin our project, we conducted user research to discover what problems and pain points dog owners have with their
                        daily lives of taking care of their dogs.</p>
                        <h3>Methods</h3>
                        <p>We conducted semi-structured interviews spanning about two weeks with four dog owners. We learned about their different
                        concerns and found the main concerns dog owners had was worrying about their dogs eating or being let out when the
                        owners were away.</p>
                        
                        
                        <h3>Findings</h3>
                        <p class="lead">Dog owners worry about their dogs when away even with care taking systems</p>
                        <p>We found that our participants had many positive elements with taking care of their dogs.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Most of our participants have a care taking system in place where the dogs are usually not left alone for longer than a
                            couple of hours.</li>
                            <li>Most of our participants have used or currently use a dog walker when leaving their dogs for extended periods of time.</li>
                            <li>All of our participants either use some method of direct or indirect observation.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>However, we also discovered several pain points for these dog owners</p>
                        
                        <ul>
                            <li>Dog owners still worry about their dogs when they are away and do not necessarily feel comfortable with their existing
                            care taking systems.</li>
                            <li>Dog owners worry about their eating habits and outdoor activity when away.
                            Some dog owners also avoid traveling to not leave their dogs in the care of someone else.</li>
                            <li>Dog owners also desired more interaction between the dogs and themselves even when away at work or traveling.</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        
                        
                        <p>Our team’s goal was to alleviate these pain points for dog owners</p>
                        <h3>Ideation</h3>
                        
                        <p>
                        Moving forward with our research, we conducted a thematic analysis of our interview transcripts. From our thematic
                        analysis, we identified 6 salient tasks that dog owners engaged in.
                        </p>
                        
                        <ol>
                            <li>Feeding Dogs</li>
                            <li>Letting Dogs In and Out</li>
                            <li>Monitoring Dogs</li>
                            <li>Maintaining Health of Dogs</li>
                            <li>Traveling by Car with Dogs</li>
                            <li>Traveling by Plane with Dogs</li>
                        </ol>
                        
                        
                        <p>
                        For this project, our team decided to address the first four tasks because they were considered more important from our
                        participants. In addition, traveling was not common among our participants so our team moved forward with a product
                        meant for the home, to be able to impact a larger population of dog owners.
                        
                        With the four tasks of feeding, letting dogs in or out, monitoring dogs, and maintaining the health of dogs in mind. We
                        brainstormed different products to address these tasks. Our three main ideas were a robot, smart collar, and smart
                        crate.

                        <p class="lead">Our concept is a robot that is able to accomplish the sorts of tasks necessary to properly care for a dog left at home
                        by itself. This means being generally autonomous, and capable of navigating the terrain of a home. Being able to
                        recognize what the various objects that occupy a home, and to interact with them in meaningful ways. The robot has to be
                        able to locate and open doors, recognize and monitor the dog, locate toys and use them to play with the dog, locate food
                        dishes and dispense food into them. Furthermore, it must have a system or programming and control that is intuitive and
                        easy to operate for all users. Toward that end, we elected to have an app that can be run on computers or mobile devices
                        that is the primary means of interacting with the robot. This application allows the user to initially program the robot
                        so that it is familiar with the home in which it will be operating, and then to schedule the events that will accomplish
                        those tasks which the user needs to be done while they are away from home. These tasks can be done autonomously by the
                        robot, or if the user desires, activated and controlled manually by the user through specific controls.

                        <p>With our design concept in mind, we set out to create low-fidelity prototypes to test and flesh out our concept. Because
                        of the time constraints of this project, our team mainly focused on creating the mobile app companion for the robot.</p>
                        <h3>Robot Prototype</h3>
                        <p>Our team did not prioritize prototyping the robot, because we already “have” an existing prototype and model existing
                        with Boston Dynamic’s SpotMini.</p>
                        <h3>Mobile Application Prototypes</h3>
                        <p>For our paper prototypes, creating our interface on paper allowed us to refine and formulate the design without too much
                        investment. This allowed us to revise the app design several times. Testing with our potential users helped refine it
                        further. To show the full process, we’ll go over our tasks in our initial prototype, what we changed, and finally the
                        same task views in our final paper and digital prototypes.</p>
                        
                        <p>Our app is based on a design of five screens: a home page, a live page, a schedule page, a settings page, and a media
                        library page. The user starts out on the home screen and proceeds to tap on one of the buttons on the bottom to
                        continue.</p>
                        
                        
                        <p>When we performed user testing, we focused in on two tasks in particular: monitoring the dog, and letting the dog
                        in/out.</p>
                        
                        <p>Monitoring the dog is fairly simple — the user starts on the home screen, taps the “Live” icon, and ends on the
                        live/camera page.</p>
                        <img src="img/monitor.jpg" class="w-25">

                        To let the dog in and out, the user would have two options. First, they could do so manually from the camera page,
                        clicking “Manual controls” and then “Door”.</p>
                        <img src="img/monitor2.jpg" class="w-25">

                        Second, they could tap the “Schedule” icon on the main page, and add a new event to let the dog out with the + icon.</p>

                        This is from our initial version of the prototype. However, we went through two different phases of testing. Our team
                        first conducted heuristic evaluations with our classmates then usability testing with our target users.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Heuristic Evaluations</h3>
                        
                        <p>Our feedback from the evaluations showed many improvements to be made. We had several issues needed to fix such as
                        adding in a navigation icon for the home page, making the language and design more consistent between screens, and
                        making it clear what to do in the case of errors when conducting a task or deleting an event.</p>

                        <h3>Usability Testing</h3>
                        
                        
                        <p>With user testing, we were able to improve our interface usability greatly. We conducted three usability tests with dog
                        owners, asking them to do a series of tasks. Our participants were chosen purposefully. We utilized our TA for
                        expert-based testing and we used two other dog owners for our user-based testing. As for the methods used, we had a task
                        list that we wanted our users to walk us through doing, using our paper prototype application. The tasks for our users
                        included opening and closing the doors to let their dog out, feeding their dogs, playing with their dogs, seeing a live
                        feed of their dogs and manually controlling that feed, creating an event, and taking a picture and a clip of their dog.</p>
                        
                        <p>The revisions we made after user testing reflected the feedback we received. We made each screen match each other by
                        making a consistent home bar at the bottom. We cleared up some of the terms we used that confused our users, such as
                        continue when we wanted to inform our users to confirm the action they’ve selected. We also made the task of creating
                        and deleting an event much smoother and we made it easier to take a picture or a video of your dog using our product.</p>

                            <p>Our final design shows the much improved consistency and revisions from our testing. Our team felt that many of the 
                            concerns and feedback we received were well implemented with our final design. Here are some of the same tasks, shown 
                            in full digital glory.</p>
                            
                            <h3>Monitoring the Dog</h3>

                            <h3>Letting the Dog in and Out</h3>

                            <p>The letting in/out process has the same two flows, but with revised wording. First, the manual letting dog in/out process.</p>

                            <p>Scheduling an event is mainly the same “flow” as well. The user starts on any screen, taps on “Events”, then taps on “Add Event” to add an event.</p>

                            <p>During our research, we found that our typical users wanted a hands-off approach taking care of their dogs while
                                they
                                were away yet still being able to interact with their dogs. Automation was therefore key, while at the same time
                                providing the high level of functionality that the sorts of tasks revolving around pet care required. We found
                                our
                                potential users would often be paying someone to come to their house while the user was away, and do the sorts
                                of the
                                things and solve the sorts of problems that our product aims to do.</p>
                        
                            <p>In order to offer the same ease of use, while still being capable of accomplishing these same tasks, we
                                recognized we
                                would need a product that was robust and capable of performing tasks such as; navigating the space of a typical
                                home,
                                recognizing various objects within a home, opening doors, closing doors, recognizing when doors are open or
                                closed,
                                finding a dog dish inside of a home, finding dog toys inside of a home, using a dog toy to play with a dog,
                                filling a
                                dog dish with food, finding and having the capacity to broadcast video of a dog. We also needed a way for a user
                                to
                                automate as many of these processes as they desired, while still maintaining the ability to take over with a
                                sort of
                                manual control for personal interaction.</p>
                        
                            <p>The biggest limitation of our project is the cost overhead of developing this technology. This isn’t something
                                we’re
                                approaching in designing it, but the closest product in the real world, Boston Dynamic’s Robot MiniSpot, costs
                                ~$22k.
                                This is not very affordable in terms of what our goals are. The technology in creating one of these robots is
                                still in
                                development and is highly dependent on things like machine learning and computer vision. In future projects, we
                                believe
                                that one thing we will work on minimizing is the cost of creating this robot without trading too much
                                functionality.
                                Making it more realistic and affordable would be a big focus.</p>
                        
                            <p>One of the main ways that our project can evolve in the future is taking advantage of the constantly evolving
                                technology
                                that is developed for automated robots. This technology is undergoing large amounts of investment and has a
                                large
                                community dedicated to bringing technology to consumers at affordable prices. We expect to see the cost to
                                produce, and
                                therefore the cost of sale consistently decrease in the coming years. Likewise, battery technology is ever
                                improving,
                                providing for longer times without needed to recharge. This should allow us to increase our potential user base
                                as the
                                product becomes more and more affordable. We will add more functionality to our application in the future, but
                                it’s core
                                is built, and will be adaptable to future hardware designs. However fancy someone’s robot is, they’ll still want
                                to
                                schedule events, and look at a live feed of their dog.
